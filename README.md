# Waste Equity Platform

Waste Equity Platform is a planned public-data analysis platform for waste-management equity and potential waste-facility location recommendations across the Seoul Metropolitan Area.

The first implementation scope covers the full Seoul Metropolitan Area:

- Seoul
- Incheon
- Gyeonggi-do

This repository currently contains project governance documents, the Phase 0 local API-probe package (with live-verified RCIS, SGIS, and VWorld contracts), and the Phase 1 backend: a Docker Compose stack with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, a FastAPI service, Alembic migrations for the core metadata schema, and health/data-operations endpoints. It does not yet contain the frontend, production API ingestion, waste metrics, or facility recommendation logic.

## Run the Phase 1 stack

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Shutdown:

```bash
docker compose down
```

The Phase 1 API runs at:

- Health: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Data sources: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data-sources`
- Data freshness: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/data-freshness`
- OpenAPI JSON: `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

See [backend/README.md](backend/README.md) for local development without Docker.

## Planned Technical Direction

- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MapLibre GL
- Backend: FastAPI, Python, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- Database: PostgreSQL and PostGIS
- Data ingestion: httpx, pandas, GeoPandas
- Automation: separate scheduler process
- Local infrastructure: Docker Compose
- Testing: pytest, Vitest, Playwright

## Planned Data Categories

- Waste generation and treatment statistics
- Waste-treatment facilities
- Population and administrative boundaries
- Land-use and zoning information
- Real-time air quality
- Weather, wind direction, and wind speed

## Core Data Principles

The platform must use real Korean public data and must not present mock, generated, estimated, fallback, or sample data as official public data. Every displayed analytical metric must include its source and reference period. Annual, monthly, periodically updated, and real-time data must be clearly distinguished.

The frontend must not call Korean government APIs directly. Future ingestion and API access must go through backend or scheduler-controlled services using credentials loaded only from environment variables.

## Current Status

Phase 0 established governance, planning, and live data-source validation through Phase 0.7 (RCIS PID discovery, recommendation GO). Phase 1 adds the Docker Compose infrastructure, PostGIS database, core metadata schema, and backend health/data-operations API. Phase 2 production ingestion has not begun. See:
